## Overview

- **Personal Project:** I have always been fascinated by automation, and this is a step in the direction of automating small tasks, such as emails.
- **Programming:** I do not find this much of a challenge, however, I do plan to stretch myself with features that would create this project into a library, allowing me to use it on future projects.
- **Additional Programming:** I want this system to do more than just send emails. I would like to implement email designs and an API to view email statistics.
- **Programming language:** I chose to do this in Python due to working with **Python3** for many years now. I also chose Python because this system is mainly data oriented. I will also try to implement other languages to optimise if necessary.
- **Inspiration:** There was no true inspiration for this project, I wanted to implement interesting features into new projects like [APSS](https://github.com/alexsmith2910/AirlinePassengerServiceSystem/), as this would be a system or service an airline would need. Therefore, instead of creating this project for the APSS itself, it made sense to create it for other projects too.
